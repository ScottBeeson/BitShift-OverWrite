# BitSwitch OverWrite (BSOW)

# Introduction

 A technology inspired matching game where the game board is a mobile device (laptop).  You must match bits and write them to your HDD before your battery dies.


## Mechanics
 - Multiple Modes
   - Shift: "Twin-stick" movement similar to 10,000,000 or You Must Build A Boat (see http://eightyeightgames.com)
   - Swap: Swapping tiles a la Bejeweled
   - Switch: ???
 - match bits into nibbles or bytes
 - match nibbles into bytes
 - Write bytes to hard drive
   - Could be triggered by:
     - Matching Bytes in multiples of 4/8?
     - Manual key activation? With penalty?
     - Matching randomly dropped "save" tiles?
     - Tabbing to a separaate HDD matching board?
 - Battery as timer
 - Battery drains faster with more utilization (ie frantic, desperate movement)
